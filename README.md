# `.fits` plotting tools for ASTR 4998: Senior Thesis
This repository contains a set of tools I built for `.fits` data cube processing and visualization and CASA ADMIT line identification results parsing. It also contains a LaTex copy of my senior thesis as an Astronomy major (BA) at the University of Virginia. 

## Plot individual molecular lines from data packages generated by `ADMIT`
```
$ python3 main.py
```

## Plot contour diagrams of `.fits` cube
```
$ python3 main.py
```

# Tasks

2. Add RMS-based contour to 3d cube plots (also change plot color / line color)
3. Add latex-compatible molecule names to individual line plots
4. Update latex gen tables
5. Finish thesis report write up
